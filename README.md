- 👋 Hi, I’m @DSProfessor
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science and Applied AI for augmenting research. I love teaching Data Science concepts.
- 🌱 I’m currently buidling a web3 platform for gentlemen researchers. The idea is to popularize latest reserach findings in simpler language which anybody can understand and possibly apply in their work.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on statistical modeling, NLP, Large Language Models and how these can used for answering strategic business questions. 
- 📫 How to reach me: ruralrni@gmail.com
